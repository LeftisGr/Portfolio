            <p>Hi! Obviously I am the guy above..Studied Maths in <a href="https://www.uoi.gr/" target="_blank">University of Ioannina(UOI)</a> and I am the owner of a small business(ehocuspocus.gr).I started coding in 2023 because i needed to! I was always on the phone...calling Teo my "eshop guy" to do staff..So i got bored of that and decided to make things happen myself!Got some courses and already have learnt frontend using <span id="mpla">HTML, CSS and Javascript</span>!Never thought that i would indeed love coding!But I will not stop there..</p>

            <p>And last but not least... That is my <a href="https://ehocuspocus.gr" target="_blank">eshop</a>.Through my own eshop which is based on wordpress and lot of work by Teo on backend, I have learnt lot of things about working with wordpress and front end coding...Not playing with backend, Teo will kill me! Although had some ideas for the backend that were really usefull, like our own code for "something like an ERP app"!There is an endless thirst for learning and brainstorming aswell..Stay in touch! </p>
